How can I access termux files?
Read that article https://wiki.termux.com/wiki/Internal_and_external_storage

The easiest solution is to download an storage access framework compatible file manager like FX File Explorer Then you can follow that instructions https://wiki.termux.com/images/e/e5/FX_Termux_Home.jpg Then you can edit and view GramAddict files.

Troubleshooting
if you type on termux adb devices and you get a blank list try the following:
connect the phone to a PC and get sure you get your device ID in adb devices (from pc console)
adb tcpip 5555
adb kill-server and disconnect the cable
get back on termux and write: adb connect localhost:5555
now you should be able to see your device ID in adb devices
when I start the bot it looks like it freezes after opening IG and termux shell has been closed
edit your accounts/yourusername/config.yml file and set close-apps: false
